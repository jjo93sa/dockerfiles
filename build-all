# Title:  build-all
#
# Description:
#   Script to create an image for each Dockerfile found in a directory. Will
#   build Docker images for multiple architectures (configuration-dependent).
#   Docker for Mac will quite happily build arm32v6 (and I believe other)
#   images, which are useful for Raspberry Pi deployment.
#
#   Attempts to use GNU parallel (https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)
#   to speed-up the image creation & push to a registry. See the help text by
#   running ./build-all -h.
#
#   We define three types of Dockerfile to build:
#     Type 1 - Sandard Docker images, which may be used standalone or as the
#              basis for another image.
#     Type 2 - Base images, which are those that may not be used standalone,
#              but are intended to be used as the base of another Docker image
#     Type 3 - These are images derived from a Type 1 or Type 2 image, which
#              implies that the parent images must be built before the Type 3
#              files.
#
#   We ensure that the Type 1 and 2 images are built first. Type 3 images are
#   listed in a file called "subordinate". This file must have blank line if
#   no dependent, or Type 3 Docker files exist, otherwise no images will be
#   built.
#
# Dependencies:
#   (1) Assumes that the Dockerfiles are contained in a structure like this:
#       ./project-name/Dockerfile
#   (2) Assumes any Type 3 Docker files are listed in a file called
#       "subordinate" in the root of the Docker file structure. (See example
#       in this repo.)
#
# Credits:
#   Heavily based on the build-all script of jessfraz, see:
#   https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles/blob/master/build-all.sh
#
# Usage:
#   Usage of this file is very simple:
#
#   (0) Login to your Docker registry (the one specified with the -r switch);
#   (1) Place this script in the root of your Dockerfile project;
#   (2) Execute the script ./build-all with the appropriate options, which are
#       summarized as:
#       build-all -h        Print help and exit
#           -a ARCH   Comma-separated list of architectures to build; default:
#                     x86-64. Building for foreign architectures is system
#                     dependent
#           -b JOBS   Jobs count to use if GNU Parallel is installed; default: 2
#           -d DIR    Set the Dockerfile search directory to DIR; default: current
#                     working directory
#           -r REG    Set the upstream registry to REG; default: rw.j2o.it
#           -t TAG    Set the tag to apply to new images; default: latest
#       Two environment variables are used to control the docker build command:
#       NO_CACHE - which is used to set the --no-cache switch &
#       QUIET - which is used to set the -q switch
#   (3) Check the build-errors.txt file for any problems during the build.
