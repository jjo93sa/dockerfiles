## dockerfiles

### About

Docker files that I use on servers, my Raspberry Pi's and on Docker for macOS. Many of these have been inspired (and not a few copied) by the incredible work of [Jess Frazelle](https://github.com/jessfraz).

Typically, I use these images on macOS instead of installing the equivalent utilitiy from something like Homebrew or MacPorts.

### Dependencies

Various - listed in the individual Docker files

### Usage

0. Build the images
1. Run the container

I try to include commands for running the container in the header of each Docker file.
